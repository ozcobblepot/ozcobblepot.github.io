    <h1>Trees by Joyce Kilmer</h1>
    <div class="poem-tree">
      <p>I think that I shall never see</p>
      <p>a poem lovely as a tree.</p>
      <p>A tree whose hungry mouth is prest</p>
      <p>against the earth's sweet flowing breast;</p>
      <p>A tree that looks at God all day,</p>
      <p>and lifts her leafy arms to pray;</p>
      <p>A tree that may in summer wear</p>
      <p>a nest of robins in her hair;</p>
      <p>Upon whose bosom snow has lain,</p>
      <p>who intimately lives with rain.</p>
      <p>Poems are made by fools like me,</p>
      <p class="special">but only God can make a tree.</p>
